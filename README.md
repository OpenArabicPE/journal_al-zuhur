# journal_al-zuhur

The full text of *al-ZuhÅ«r* is available from [*al-maktaba al-shamela*](http://shamela.ws/index.php/book/36534). Digital facsimiles are available from [archive.alsharekh.org](http://archive.alsharekh.org/newmagazineYears.aspx?MID=40) (formerly archive.sakhrit.co) and in high-resolution [University of Bonn](http://digitale-sammlungen.ulb.uni-bonn.de/urn/urn:nbn:de:hbz:5:1-90222), which also serves through IIIF.

From a brief look at the facsimiles it appears that page breaks in shamela.ws correspond to the material artefact.
